so you guys are twins?

I envy you

You know about twin, they are one. each other is half, your life must be very interesting. there is no boundary between them. no privacy, of course. even personaly and exprience, sometimes it can be same also. You know, there is a manga named monster Written by Naoki Urasawa. There is an experience only one of them through it, but both of them feel it like real one. That's what make them more twin in experience and personality.

Only skill and knowlege, which i think, make them difference. Also there is a feeling made you think that your life is only half and not complete without the other half which is the other one.

The thing is you realize that it will makes your burden only half and your achievement is half also. You also realize, it will easy for you to help each other, and to eat each other. When you become one, it mean you are the other one half, or other one is your half.
