### [Intro: Danyka Nadeau]

Baby

Can you...

Baby

Can you...

Baby

Can you...

### [Verse 1: Danyka Nadeau]

Pull me close and you say you'll never run away

Think that love is a game and now we've gone insane

But what we have is what one spends a lifetime searching for



‘Cause with you I feel amazing, never felt before

Why would I be so ashamed, found love worth fighting for

Standing right at the gates, walking your stairway to heaven

### [Chorus: Danyka Nadeau]

Baby I'm in love

And I can't get enough

I'm yours truly, truly, truly, baby

Truly



Baby I'm in love

Can you feel the rush

I'm yours truly, truly, truly baby

Truly

Baby

Baby, baby, baby...

### [Verse 2: Danyka Nadeau]

Pull me close and you say you'll never run away

Think that love is a game and now we've gone insane

But what we have is what one spends a lifetime searching for



‘Cause with you I feel amazing, never felt before

Why would I be so ashamed, found love worth fighting for

Standing right at the gates, walking your stairway to heaven

### [Chorus: Danyka Nadeau]

Baby I'm in love

And I can't get enough

I'm yours truly, truly, truly baby

Truly

Baby I'm in love

Can you feel the rush

I'm yours truly, truly, truly baby

Truly

### [Outro: Danyka Nadeau]

Baby

Baby, baby, baby...

Baby

Can you...

Baby

Can you...
